<b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
Last updated: October 29, 2015<br>
<br>

Our mission is to help people get active and fit. To accomplish this, we develop a platform that allows users to track their exercise activity and encourage and compete with one another. This Privacy Policy outlines how we use the data that you provide. The Privacy Policy applies to our website located at www.updowntech.com (the 'Site') and to our applications (the 'Apps') - including web-based, Android, and iOS applications. The Site and the Apps are collectively referred to as (the 'Service'). By using the Updown Service you consent that we may process the data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
In this policy, the terms 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' and 'Updown' refer to Updown Technologies, Inc. The terms 'you,' 'your,' and 'yours' refer to the end user using the Service.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy may periodically change. Any future changes will not affect data that was collected under a previous version of this policy. If any modification substantially changes your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change.
<br><br>
<b>Data We Collect</b>
<br><br>
<b>When You Create an Updown Account</b>
<br>
In order to use the Updown Apps, you must create an Updown account. When you create an Updown account, we ask for some personal information, including your email address and date of birth. Your email address will be your Updown account ID, and you will use this to log into your account. We do not display your email address to other users. Your birthdate is used to verify that you are at least 13 years of age.
<br><br>
<b>When You Add Information to Your Account</b>
<br>
You can customize your Updown experience by adding other types of information to your account, such as entering a workout, adding a photo to your profile, or sending messages to friends. We collect this information as you add it and store it in your Updown account.
<br><br>

Updown collects industry standard data from everyone who visits our Site. This includes log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you, the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access pages on the Site. We use this type of information to optimize the Site for your benefit and to ensure the Site is working properly.

<b>Data That Could Identify You</b>
<br>
Personal information is data that could identify you such as your name, email address, or other data that could be reasonably traced back to you. We will only share personal information under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
When it is necessary to share this information with companies who are contractually obligated to provide us with services such as credit card processing and reward delivery. These companies are required by contract to maintain the security of any personal information they receive from us.
</li>
<li>
If we believe that disclosure of this data is required to comply with the law or when it is in our interest to protect the security of our property or other legal rights or to protect the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Service.

<li>
We may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company.

<b>De-identified Data</b>
<br>
Updown may share or sell aggregated, de-identified data that does not identify you. When we provide this information, we perform appropriate procedures so that the data does not identify you, and we contractually prohibit recipients of the data from re-identifying it back to you.
<br><br>
<b>Data That You Direct Us to Share</b>
<br>
We may share data with other parties at your direction. For example, you might authorize us to link your Updown account to your Facebook. Once you direct us to share data with a third party, that data is governed by the third party's privacy policy. You can revoke your consent to share data with a third party at any time in your Updown account settings.

<br><br>
<b>Security of Data</b>
<br><br>
Updown strongly values the security of your data and uses both technical and administrative controls to maintain the security of your data. No data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective, and as such we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us.

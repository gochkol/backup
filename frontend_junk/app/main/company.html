      <p>
      Our founders saw a problem of how in their previous jobs involving long days at the office, it was hard to stay motivated to be fit. And sometimes, despite strong motivation, life just gets in the way of established routines.
      We wanted to create a solution that makes it as easy as possible for people in a modern fast-paced society to exercise and be healthy.
      So in 2015, we founded Updown in Madison, Wisconsin with the goal of making the world a more active place. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Our vision is that Updown will make fitness fun, simple, and rewarding. To this end, we are developing an easy to use,
      smart fitness application. It uses a proprietary algorithm to generate personalized routines for users that can be done regardless of how much time the person has or where he or she is located.
      We also know that most things are better with friends, so we're building a full social network into Updown that enables our users to share fitness experiences and encourage one another.
      </p>
      <p>
      We launched the Updown application in November 2015 to very positive feedback, and each day we add hundreds of users to our growing community. We have a long way to go to fully realize our goal,
      but our maniacal focus on our community of users and on our vision helps us make Updown better every single day.

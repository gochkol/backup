These are the plans for a mutualist bank with all the documentation for how to run such a bank.

The bank if founded by a draft of the articles of the bank and the first donation made to the bank.
Actions taken at the bank:
1)Donation - Make a donation to the general fund and recieve a collection receipt
2)Collection - Turn in a collection receipt for a package
3)Deposit - Put money/capital in your account from outside the bank
4)Withdrawl - Take out money/capital from the bank
5)Transfer - Move money to another person at the bank
6)Loan - Give money to another person at a rate with set terms
7)Secure - Secure an loan as a third party
8)Buy - Place a buy order on something in the market
9)Sell - Place a sell order on an account asset
10)Insure - Insure an asset as a third party
11)Preside - Must be made on all accounts simultaneously to make a new precedent
12)Vote - like, dislike, agree, disagree, abstain
13)Open - Start a monthly meeting
14)Meet - Record the minutes of a monthly meeting
15)Close - End a monthly meeting

The bank itself is rund by the Fund Manager who is elected at a monthly meeting by the contributing donors
or is appointed when there is no other Fund Manager and they are the largest donor when a donation is made.
The bank keeps several ledgers:
1)Donations Ledger - Keeps track of all donations
2)Collections Ledger - Keeps track of all packages taken
3)Accounts Ledger - Keeps track of all accounts including the main account
4)Fund Ledger - Keeps track of all funds, long term investments and accounts are on this ledger but don't count toward the fund and
  also on this ledger counting toward the fund are the short term investments, the cash on hand, and the packages.
5)Minutes Ledger - Keeps track of monthly meeting minutes

The bank is created when the first donation is made and taken to make the first account. The person who makes
this donation automatically becomes the fund manager. A new presidence is set upon completion of this. Monthly
meeting take place every four weeks at the place of the precedence at the time of the precidence (ie if it is set
for Saturday at 6:00PM then the next meeeting will be the same day and time 4 weeks later). For a new precedence to
be set all account holders must be in the same place at the same time.

Rules:
1)When a person makes a donation it must be larger than the largest package and it cannot be an ammount that would
create a packet for the same ammount as the donation. When a person makes their first donation they immediately take
the largest packet less than their donation. This donation and immediate collection mark the opening of their account.
They immediately have to donate again to maintain their account standing. And make their account able to hold money.
2)An account can only hold as much money as the sum of the users available donation tickets. When money is added to a
persons account, if they have more than the sum of their donation tickets, a new donation is made equal to the smallest
possible donation and the process is repeated until they are in good standing. A person cannot deposit more than the
difference between their current account value and the total supported by their donation tickets.
3)Unredeemed donation tickets can vote equal to their donation value
4)Donations can be no larger than the total fund size, must be larger than the largest current packet, and cannot made if
they produce a packet of equal value.
5)The fund size is the total of the packets, the cash on hand, and the short term investments
6)There are cooldowns for actions placed on the individual and the community. Individuals have to wait as long as they
have waited before taking an action before they can take another action. The community has to wait at least as long as
they waited since the last time an action was taken before they can take a new action. When positions are placed or
created they are checked for action before they are resolved to the open market.
7)Donation reciepts pay monthly dividends to their account holders equal to the value of the smallest packet and are
taken from the cash on hand.
8)Accounts considered in bad standing are defined as follows. If the account has a negative value or a value less than
what is required to make a donation and no valid donation receipts then the account is in bad standing. Bad standing accounts
are charged an ammount equal to the smallest packet. To come into good standing a donation must be made or the balance
made positive. Accounts in bad standing with less than the largest package ammount value in the red at the time of account
rectification are suspended. Suspended accounts must be put in good standing before they can be used anymore. An account
can be closed at anytime by collecting on all donation reciepts, ending all positions, and emptying the account.
9)The fund manager has to perform all transactions.





Sample Fund
Fund created by A1 at time T0 with a donation of $100.00
Donation made, fund at $100.00, package P0 created with $1.00
A1 recieves package P0 and has account with $1.00
Since no donations on account min donation is at $0, person makes max package donation $1.00
Fund at $100.00, package P1 $1.00 package made with T1 $1.00 donation voucher to person A
Fund at $100.00 = $99COH & package P1 $1.00 <=> voucher T1 to person A1
At first month $1.00 paid out
Fund at $99.00 = $98COH & package P1 $1.00 <=> voucher T1 $1.00 to person A1, A1 account with $1.00
12 * (1 donation voucher)*($1.00) + ($9.90 = 10% fund value) = $21.90 new cash on hand ammount
Fund at $99.00 = $76.10 Short & $21.90 COH & package P1 = $1.00
Last long gain 0%, 50% fund is $49.50
Fund at $72.40 = (Last gain percentage is -34.954% Long $26.60) & short $49.50 & COH $21.90 & package P1 = $1
Last gain percentage is -34.954%, interest earned is 0%, (10% of short is $4.95 added back to COH), consider 10% of total invesments 26.60 + 49.50 = 76.10 ... 10% = $7.61
Fund at $72.40 = (long $26.60) & short $44.55 & COH $26.85 & package P1 = $1.00
Accounts are resolved, $1.00 cannot make a donation so it does nothing.
Election is held and winner gets 1% of cash on hand = $.27
Goes to A1 => account has $1.27 with P1 = $1.00 voucher, puts account in bad standing, $1.01 donation made
Fund at $72.13 = (long $26.60) & short $44.55 & COH $26.58 & package P1 = $1.00
Fund at $73.14, package P2 = $.73 created from cash on hand
Fund at $73.14, (long $26.60) & short $44.55 & COH $26.86 $ package P1 = $1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 has account = $.26 and donation reciepts for P1-$1.00 = $1.00, P2-$1.01 = $.73, with total donation $2.01
The budget for the first months admin fees was $0
Nine times this months payout for management is 9*$.27 = $2.43 fund is assumed to be fully funded accounting budget
$2.43 is 9.047% of the total cash on hand. If this is assumed to be spent on admin then the remaining for the next month
must be calculated and the next month planned out as if nothing happened, then the next month budgeted for and so on and so forth,
the budget for the next six months worth of admin must be set aside from the cash on hand to keep the fund running.
Example of how this is done:
Fund at next month:
Fund at $70.71, (long $26.60) & short $44.55 & COH $24.43 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $.26 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Pay dividends of $.73 X 2 = $1.46 to A1 from COH for P1 and P2
Fund at $69.25, (long $26.60) & short $44.55 & COH $22.97 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.52 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Transfer from cash on hand to short, 12 * (2 donation vouchers) * ($.73) + ($6.93 = 10% fund) = $24.45 greater than COH no transfer made
Last long gain -34.954%, 50% of fund is 34.63. Double the profit percentage is -69.908% meaning no profit, since negative.
$44.55 - $34.63 = $9.92 moved to the long.
Fund at $59.33, last change -14.325% (long $36.52) & short $34.63 & COH $22.97 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.52 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Last gain percentage is -14.325%, intrest earned is 0%, 10% of short is $3.46 moved back to cash on hand
Fund at $59.33, last change -14.325% (long $36.52) & short $31.17 & COH $26.43 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.52 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Accounts are resolved A1 does not donate under cap
Elections Held A1 wins and get paid 1% of cash on hand = $.26
Fund at $59.07, last change -14.325% (long $36.52) & short $31.17 & COH $26.17 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.78 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Nine times this months payout for management is 9*$.26 = $2.34 times the six month ago funding which is 100%, becomes next months admin budget.
$2.34 is 8.942% of the cash on hand for next month leading to that months admin budget.
This process is continued to observe the total life of the fund if nothing happens.

Accounts are resolved, $1.00 cannot make a donation so it does nothing.
Election is held and winner gets 1% of cash on hand = $.30
Goes to A1 => account has $1.30 with P1 = $1.00 voucher, puts account in bad standing, $1.01 donation made
Fund at $72.10 = (long $26.60) & short $41.89 & COH $29.21 & package P1 = $1.00

The budget for the first months admin fees was $0
Nine times this months payout for management is 9*$.30 = $2.70 fund is assumed to be fully funded accounting budget
$2.70 is 9.156% of the total cash on hand. If this is assumed to be spent on admin then the remaining for the next month
must be calculated and the next month planned out as if nothing happened, then the next month budgeted for and so on and so forth,
the budget for the next six months worth of admin must be set aside from the cash on hand to keep the fund running.
Example of how this is done:
Fund at next month:
Budget of $2.70 spent leaving
Fund at $70.41, (long $26.60) & short $41.89 & COH $26.79 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $.29 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Pay dividends of $.73 X 2 = $1.46 to A1 from COH for P1 and P2
Fund at $68.95, (long $26.60) & short $41.89 & COH $25.33 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.75 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Transfer from cash on hand to short, 12 * (2 donation vouchers) * ($.73) + ($6.90 = 10% fund) = $24.42 less than COH
$25.33 - $24.42 = $.91
Fund at $68.95, (long $26.60) & short $42.80 & COH $24.42 & package P1 = %1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.75 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Last long gain -34.954%, 50% of fund is $34.48. Double the profit percentage is -69.908% meaning no profit, since negative. If it were less in short you would move long to short to make up difference if available.
$41.89 - $34.48 = $7.41 moved to the long.
Fund at $61.54, last change -14.325% (long $34.01) & short $35.39 & COH $24.42 & package P1 = $1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $1.75 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
Last gain percentage is -10.677%, intrest earned is 0%, 10% of investments is $6.94 moved back to cash on hand
Fund at $61.54, last change -10.677% (long $34.01) & short $28.45 & COH $31.36 & package P1 = $1.00, P2 = $.73

Accounts are resolved A1 does not donate under cap
Elections Held A1 wins and get paid 1% of cash on hand = $.31
Fund at $61.23, last change -10.677% (long $34.01) & short $28.45 & COH $31.05 & package P1 = $1.00, P2 = $.73
A1 => $2.06 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73, TD = $2.01
This is bad standing so a donation is made for $1.01
Funds at $62.24 new package P3-$1.01 = $.62
Funds at $62.24, last change -10.677% (long $34.01) & short $28.45 & COH $31.44 & package P1 =$1.00, P2 = $.73, P3 = $.62
A1 => $1.05 & P1-$1.00 = $1.00 & P2-$1.01 = $.73 & P3-$1.01 = $.62, TD = $3.02   Package Total = $2.65
Nine times this months payout for management is 9*$.31 = $2.79 times the six month ago funding which is 100%, becomes next months admin budget.
$2.79 is 8.874% of the cash on hand for next month leading to that months admin budget.
This process is continued to observe the total life of the fund if nothing happens. And that is used to formulate future budgets.
This calculation is added to minutes at the start of the meeting after last meetings minutes are read.

Any part of the monthly admin budget not used is added to the next month's budget, any shortfall is subtracted from the next months budget
This would work great with personal cards linked to accounts.
Depoits are made through the fund manager. And people can spend on their fund card from their account.
